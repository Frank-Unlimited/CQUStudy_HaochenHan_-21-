Well, I think we shouldn't blame it all on celebrities. Celebrity worshipping is contributed by the development of media.
Once when people only know celebrities through their music, movies and very few vivid shows, distance between idols and fans is far.
But when new media occur, elimating the limit of space and time for both sides to communicate with each other, idols increasingly become 
someone touchable, close and a neccesary part in life.
Therefore, celebrities only lead a life of their own, but it is media that exposes their life and tend to lure people to crazily worship them.
