My idea is to research the acceptance level of the e-learning among the freshmen in our school. The reason why I choose this topic is that 
recently I noticed that it it still unacceptable for some of my classmates to use e-textbook and do homework through electronic devices.
And I myself also encountered some problems concerning e-learning. So I want to know the general situation of the accepance of e-learning in
my peers and maybe explore some methods to speed up the spread of e-learning.
I found three articles related to my topic. They are respectively the advantage of the e-learning program over the undergrade students, the human and 
factors that affect students to accept e-learning and the factors affecting pupils to accept and sense e-textbooks.
